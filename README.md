#### Project Aims
The aim of the project is to explore the construction of a session-based football news recommender system utilising a hybrid filter that corresponds to the userâ€™s competency level of football. The app aims to solve current weaknesses with sport news apps concerning novices being overwhelmed with non-personalised, incomprehensible information. The system also aims to investigate and attempt to solve current weaknesses in recommender systems such as cold start, transparency and privacy.
